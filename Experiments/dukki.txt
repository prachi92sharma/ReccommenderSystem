dukki,On Ideal Lattices, Gröbner Bases and Generalized Hash Functions,In this paper, we draw connections between ideal lattices and multivariate polynomial rings over integers using Gr\"obner bases. Ideal lattices are ideals in the residue class ring, Z[x]/⟨f⟩ (here f is a monic polynomial), and cryptographic primitives have been built based on these objects. As ideal lattices in the univariate case are generalizations of cyclic lattices, we introduce the notion of multivariate cyclic lattices and show that multivariate ideal lattices are indeed a generalization of them. Based on multivariate ideal lattices, we establish the existence of collision resistant hash functions using Gr\"obner basis techniques. For the construction of hash functions, we define a worst case problem, shortest substitution problem w.r.t. an ideal in Z[x1,…,xn], and establish hardness results using functional fields.
dukki,Uniform Hypergraph Partitioning: Provable Tensor Methods and Sampling Techniques In a series of recent works, we have generalised the consistency results in the stochastic block model literature to the case of uniform and non-uniform hypergraphs. The present paper continues the same line of study, where we focus on partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs---a problem often encountered in computer vision. This work is motivated by two issues that arise when a hypergraph partitioning approach is used to tackle computer vision problems: (i) The uniform hypergraphs constructed for higher-order learning contain all edges, but most have negligible weights. Thus, the adjacency tensor is nearly sparse, and yet, not binary. (ii) A more serious concern is that standard partitioning algorithms need to compute all edge weights, which is computationally expensive for hypergraphs. This is usually resolved in practice by merging the clustering algorithm with a tensor sampling strategy---an approach that is yet to be analysed rigorously. We build on our earlier work on partitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs, and address the aforementioned issues by proposing provable and efficient partitioning algorithms. Our analysis justifies the empirical success of practical sampling techniques. We also complement our theoretical findings by elaborate empirical comparison of various hypergraph partitioning schemes.
