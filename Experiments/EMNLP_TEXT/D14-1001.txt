Abstract

ous problems using machine learning techniques
for natural language processing. The group pioneered many of the statistical methods for NLP
from statistical parsing, to natural language understanding, to statistical machine translation and machine translation evaluation metrics (BLEU metric). Roukos has over a 150 publications in the
speech and language areas and over two dozen
patents. Roukos was the lead of the group which
introduced the first commercial statistical language understanding system for conversational
telephony systems (IBM ViaVoice Telephony) in
2000 and the first statistical machine translation
product for Arabic-English translation in 2003.
He has recently lead the effort to create IBMâ€™s
offering of IBM Real-Time Translation Services
(RTTS) a platform for enabling real-time translation applications such as multilingual chat and ondemand document translation.

Electronically available multi-modal data
(primarily text and meta-data) is unprecedented in terms of its volume, variety, velocity, (and veracity). The increased interest and investment in cognitive computing for building systems and solutions that
enable and support richer human-machine
interactions presents a unique opportunity
for novel statistical models for natural language processing.
In this talk, I will describe a journey at
IBM during the past three decades in developing novel statistical models for NLP
covering statistical parsing, machine translation, and question-answering systems.
Along with a discussion of some of the recent successes, I will discuss some difficult challenges that need to be addressed to
achieve more effective cognitive systems
and applications.
