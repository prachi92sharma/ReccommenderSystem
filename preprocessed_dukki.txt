dukki uniform hypergraph partitioning provable tensor methods sampling techniques series recent works generalised consistency results stochastic block model literature case uniform non uniform hypergraphs present paper continues line study focus partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs problem often encountered computer vision work motivated issues arise hypergraph partitioning approach used tackle computer vision problems uniform hypergraphs constructed higher order learning contain edges negligible weights thus adjacency tensor nearly sparse yet binary serious concern standard partitioning algorithms need compute edge weights computationally expensive hypergraphs usually resolved practice merging clustering algorithm tensor sampling strategy approach yet analysed rigorously build earlier work partitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs address aforementioned issues proposing provable efficient partitioning algorithms analysis justifies empirical success practical sampling techniques also complement theoretical findings elaborate empirical comparison various hypergraph partitioning schemes
